# SARKAAR-AI 🤖

SARKAAR-AI is a JARVIS-inspired modular Artificial Intelligence system
designed to perform reasoning, automation, vision, voice interaction,
coding assistance, and safety-aware decision making.

This project focuses on building an agent-based AI architecture
rather than a single-purpose application.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

SARKAAR follows a modular agent-based design:

- **Sarkar Core** – Central reasoning and decision engine
- **Orchestrator** – Controls task flow between AI agents
- **Automation** – Performs system & workflow automation
- **Voice Interaction** – Enables voice-based commands
- **Vision Understanding** – Image and visual data processing
- **Knowledge Learning** – Information storage and retrieval
- **Coding Assistant** – Helps with code understanding and generation
- **System Control & Safety** – Prevents unsafe or harmful actions
